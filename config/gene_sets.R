# ======================================================================
# config/gene_sets.R
# Curated (and hypothesis-driven) host gene sets used for module scoring.
#
# Notes
# - These sets are meant to operationalize the "Vicious Cycle" blueprint.
# - Not all genes will be present in all assays/platforms (e.g., STARmap panel).
# - The scoring code will automatically intersect with available features.
#
# Citations / rationale:
# - ECM remodeling / MMP activity is central to EVT invasion and barrier remodeling.
# - Immune tolerance checkpoint signals help define immune-privileged zones.
# - Ethanolamine (EA) metabolism genes operationalize the "nutrient gradient" hypothesis.
