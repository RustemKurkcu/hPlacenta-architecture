# Figure plan + methods snippets (starter)

This is a template you can paste into a thesis/grant and fill in with results.

## Figure 1 — Dataset overview and integration

**Panel A (schematic):** Data modalities (Multiome RNA+ATAC, Slide-tags spatial RNA, STARmap-ISS panel + imputation)

**Panel B:** Multiome UMAP colored by annotated clusters (reference taxonomy)

**Panel C:** Slide-tags spatial map colored by predicted cell types (mapped to Multiome)

**Panel D:** STARmap spatial map colored by predicted cell types (mapped to Multiome)

**Key message:** We unify a common cell-type language across sequencing and imaging-based spatial methods.

**Methods snippet:**  
We used Seurat label transfer to map query cells (Slide-tags, STARmap) to a multiome RNA reference.
Anchors were identified with FindTransferAnchors and cell-type labels were transferred using TransferData
(or MapQuery when UMAP projection was required).

## Figure 2 — The “Remodeling Highway” window (Weeks 8–10)

**Panel A:** Cell-type composition over gestational week (each dataset)

**Panel B:** MMP module score (MMP2/MMP9 + ECM genes) over week in EVT and fibroblasts

**Panel C:** Spatial localization of high-MMP regions in Slide-tags and STARmap

**Key message:** A temporally restricted remodeling program creates a spatial route for invasion.

## Figure 3 — Nutritional immunity program (EA / PLD1)

**Panel A:** PLD1 expression by cell type and week (Multiome + Slide-tags)

**Panel B:** EA-metabolism module score vs week

**Panel C:** Spatial gradients: PLD1 / EA module vs distance to STB boundary

**Key message:** Host nutrient provisioning is spatially structured and temporally dynamic.

## Figure 4 — Microenvironment and cell–cell communication

**Panel A:** Neighborhood enrichment (EVT neighbors by cell type, per week)

**Panel B:** Selected ligand–receptor interactions (distance-constrained CellChat)

**Key message:** The invasion route is a coordinated tissue program, not a single-cell phenomenon.

## Methods scaffold (copy/paste)

### Spatial neighborhood analysis
We constructed a spatial neighbor graph from cell coordinates using (i) k-nearest neighbors (k=20) and
(ii) fixed-radius graphs (r=50 µm) where coordinates were available in microns. We computed observed
cell-type adjacency counts and compared them to a permutation null model generated by shuffling cell-type
labels within each section/sample.

### Temporal analysis
For each dataset we harmonized gestational week metadata and computed mean/median expression and module scores
per (week × cell type). When donor replicates were available, we aggregated to donor-level pseudobulk summaries
and performed trend testing across gestational age.

### Ratios
Gene “ratios” were computed in log space as log1p(A) − log1p(B), avoiding division by zero and reducing
heteroskedasticity in sparse single-cell measurements.
